The task solutions are created at run-time and executed by the agents in a centralized or decentralized fashion. Tasks are divided into smaller sub-tasks which are then assigned to the optimal number of robots using Robot Utility Based Task Assignment (RUTA) algorithm. The system deploys these robots using its application program interfaces (API's) and uploads programs that are integrated with a small routine code. The embedded routine allows robots to configure solutions when decentralized approach is adopted.},

These decompositions have been widely used for path planning between two points, but can be used for mapping and coverage of free spaces. In this paper, we define exact cellular decompositions where critical points of Morse functions indicate the location of cell boundaries. Morse functions are those whose critical points are non-degenerate. Between critical points, the structure of a space is effectively the same, so simple control strategies to achieve tasks, such as coverage, are feasible within each cell. This allows us to introduce a general framework for coverage tasks because varying the Morse function has the effect of changing the pattern by which a robot covers its free space. In this paper, we give examples of different Morse functions and comment on their corresponding tasks. In a companion paper, we describe the sensor-based algorithm that constructs the decomposition.},

  abstract = {Multi-robot exploration is a search of uncertainty in restricted space seeking to build a finite map by a group of robots. It has the main task to distribute the search assignments among robots in real time. In this paper, we proposed a stochastic optimization for multi-robot exploration that mimics the coordinated predatory behavior of grey wolves via simulation. Here, the robot movement is computed by the combined deterministic and metaheuristic techniques. It uses the Coordinated Multi-Robot Exploration and GreyWolf Optimizer algorithms as a new method called the hybrid stochastic exploration. Initially, the deterministic cost and utility determine the precedence of adjacent cells around a robot. Then, the stochastic optimization improves the overall solution. It implies that the robots evaluate the environment by the deterministic approach and move on using the metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed hybrid method was implemented on simple and complex maps and compared with the Coordinated Multi-Robot Exploration algorithm. The simulation results show that the stochastic optimization enhances the deterministic approach to completely explore and map out the areas.},

  abstract = {Robot Swarms (RS) is an approach that leads to the combined functioning of multiple robot systems to achieve a desired collective behaviour. Robot Swarms possess multiple benefits e.g. RS employment in calamity salvage missions: Swarms of robots of various sizes could be sent to the spots where salvage specialists can't reach securely to detect the presence of life. Swarms can be utilized as a part of military to frame a self-governing armed force. Apart from a large number of advantages, the biggest challenge for RS is its non-predictable behaviour. Architectures and protocols for working of swarms of robots have already been designed and implemented, but to improve the non-predictability of swarms either experiments with robots are to be carried out or computational simulations are performed. However, with these approaches, a deep analysis of all the possible behaviours is very difficult. To improve the non-predictability of RS we used a potent technique, formal verification to confirm that it is bug free. Researchers have realized that computer simulations alone are not capable of evaluating a system or protocol against all possible scenarios. This has encouraged us to employ model checker tools like UPAAL to evaluate Path Planning Algorithms and Alive Human Navigation through RS in disastrous situation. After verification of probabilistic behaviour of swarms, finally, we can safely claim that the collective working of a robot swarm will be free of any undesirable behaviour.},

Characterization is currently being performed in these areas by having a radiation control technician (RCT) manually monitor radiation levels with hand held instruments. Although these methods are effective for small or hard to reach areas, in large buildings such as the 300+ acre K-25 facilities located at the DOE Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) such methods are tedious and better suited for automated floor characterization systems. The purpose of this paper is to describe the multirobot mobile automated characterisation system and reduced access characterisation subsystem, their cooperative activities, and their current status and future directions.},

  abstract = {This work examines the relationships among drone swarm characteristics and how they affect swarm performance. A swarm of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is implemented in simulation to cooperatively gather situational awareness data during the first few hours after a major natural disaster. The swarm is controlled by prioritized sets of relatively simple, reactive behaviors, the totality of which result in the emergence of a form of collective intelligence. The behaviors are designed to optimize the coverage area of a simulated camera mounted on each UAV. The behaviors are implemented in simulation on swarms of sizes from 10 to 50 UAVs. The UAVs are each assigned one of 3 different roles, or ``personality types'': Social Searcher, Antisocial Searcher, or Relay. 100 different size and personality type distribution configurations were compared over 1000 simulation runs to determine explore the effect of swarm parameters on search success over the target area. The results show that the swarm is successful in locating over 90 \% of survivors in less than 40 minutes using the most effective personality type distributions. Results also show that, within in the context of the particular simulation scenario, the addition of any number of Relay UAVs tends to decrease performance of the swarm when compared to a distribution that does not include any Relays. More generally, the work demonstrates the value of the novel approach of applying design of experiment principles to simulation experiments in order to explore optimal swarm configurations.},

  abstract = {This paper compares performance metrics of a centralized directed swarm with performance metrics of a decentralized undirected swarm in a search and rescue mission using a simulation experiment. The centralized directed swarm is controlled by a simulated human operator in a Manned Unmanned Teaming (MUMT) scenario. The operator makes decisions regarding direction of the swarm based on a variable called Quality of Knowledge (QoK). QoK represents the accuracy of the operator's knowledge of the mission situation at any given point in time. In the experiment, 20,000 simulation runs were performed on swarms of sizes 10-50 in an area sized 2 x 2 kilometers. Within the swarms, individual entities were allocated three different behavior roles. Results show that larger swarm sizes (20 or more entities) with standard WiFi range perform well as decentralized, undirected swarms. As the swarm size is reduced to less than 20 entities and the WiFi range is compromised to less than 200 meters, the centralized swarm with a high level of QoK begins to perform well. These results suggest that future research could examine the optimal role of a centralized human operator while controlling a swarm of UAVs to accomplish mission goals. In this study, the inclusion of a centralized human controller with perfect knowledge of the environment, including locations of disaster survivors, showed very little positive impact on mission success when the swarm size exceeded 20 entities and the WiFi range of each entity was set to a range of 400 meters or more.},

Traditionally, an unsupervised learning method, hierarchical clustering offers a formalism for identifying and representing spatially cohesive and segregated robot groups at different resolutions by relating the continuous space of configurations to the combinatorial space of trees. We formalize and exploit this relation, developing computationally effective reactive algorithms for navigating through the combinatorial space in concert with geometric realizations for a particular choice of the hierarchical clustering method. These constructions yield computationally effective vector field planners for both hierarchically invariant as well as transitional navigation in the configuration space. We apply these methods to the centralized coordination and control of n perfectly sensed and actuated Euclidean spheres in a d-dimensional ambient space (for arbitrary n and d). Given a desired configuration supporting a desired hierarchy, we construct a hybrid controller that is quadratic in n and algebraic in d and prove that its execution brings all but a measure zero set of initial configurations to the desired goal, with the guarantee of no collisions along the way.},

We also categorize the line flocking literature by the energy-saving mechanism that is exploited by the agents. We present several approaches aimed at minimizing the communication and computational requirements in real systems via neighbor filtering and event-driven planning, and conclude with our perspective on the outlook and future research direction of optimal flocking as a field.},

It is based on the development of a continuous abstraction of the swarm obtained by modeling population fractions and defining the task allocation problem as the selection of rates of robot ingress and egress to and from each task. These rates are used to determine probabilities that define stochastic control policies for individual robots, which, in turn, produce the desired collective behavior. We address the problem of computing rates to achieve fast redistribution of the swarm subject to constraint(s) on switching between tasks at equilibrium. We present several formulations of this optimization problem that vary in the precedence constraints between tasks and in their dependence on the initial robot distribution. We use each formulation to optimize the rates for a scenario with four tasks and compare the resulting control policies using a simulation in which 250 robots redistribute themselves among four buildings to survey the perimeters.},

In this paper, we explore the state-of-the-art in engineering self-adaptive systems and identify potential improvements in the design process.},

We present a probabilistic approach for the coordination of multiple robots which, in contrast to previous approaches, simultaneously takes into account the costs of reaching a target point and the utility of target points. The utility of target points is given by the size of the unexplored area that a robot can cover with its sensors upon reaching a target position. Whenever a target point is assigned to a specific robot, the utility of the unexplored area visible from this target position is reduced for the other robots. This way, a team of multiple robots assigns different target points to the individual robots. The technique has been implemented and tested extensively in real-world experiments and simulation runs. The results given in this paper demonstrate that our coordination technique significantly reduces the exploration time compared to previous approaches.},

Our result is that the ideas proposed in the six studied algorithms have been in the literature of metaheuristics for years and that the only novelty in these self-proclaimed novel algorithms is six different terminologies derived from the use of new metaphors. We discuss the reasons why the metaphors that inspired these algorithms are misleading and ultimately useless as a source of inspiration to design effective optimization tools. Finally, we discuss the rationale often presented by the authors of metaphor-based algorithms as their motivation to propose more algorithms of this type, which is based on a wrong understanding of the no-free-lunch theorems for optimization.},

These algorithms utilize a market-based decision strategy as the mechanism for decentralized task selection and use a consensus routine based on local communication as the conflict resolution mechanism to achieve agreement on the winning bid values. Under reasonable assumptions on the scoring scheme, both of the proposed algorithms are proven to guarantee convergence to a conflict-free assignment, and it is shown that the converged solutions exhibit provable worst-case performance. It is also demonstrated that CBAA and CBBA produce conflict-free feasible solutions that are robust to both inconsistencies in the situational awareness across the fleet and variations in the communication network topology. Numerical experiments confirm superior convergence properties and performance when compared with existing auction-based task-allocation algorithms.},

  abstract = {The use of aerial swarms to solve real-world problems has been increasing steadily, accompanied by falling prices and improving performance of communication, sensing, and processing hardware. The commoditization of hardware has reduced unit costs, thereby lowering the barriers to entry to the field of aerial swarm robotics. A key enabling technology for swarms is the family of algorithms that allow the individual members of the swarm to communicate and allocate tasks amongst themselves, plan their trajectories, and coordinate their flight in such a way that the overall objectives of the swarm are achieved efficiently. These algorithms, often organized in a hierarchical fashion, endow the swarm with autonomy at every level, and the role of a human operator can be reduced, in principle, to interactions at a higher level without direct intervention. This technology depends on the clever and innovative application of theoretical tools from control and estimation. This paper reviews the state of the art of these theoretical tools, specifically focusing on how they have been developed for, and applied to, aerial swarms. Aerial swarms differ from swarms of ground-based vehicles in two respects: they operate in a three-dimensional space and the dynamics of individual vehicles adds an extra layer of complexity. We review dynamic modeling and conditions for stability and controllability that are essential in order to achieve cooperative flight and distributed sensing. The main sections of this paper focus on major results covering trajectory generation, task allocation, adversarial control, distributed sensing, monitoring, and mapping. Wherever possible, we indicate how the physics and subsystem technologies of aerial robots are brought to bear on these individual areas.},

  abstract = {As technology advances, the places we have been able to explore have drastically increased. However, the advancements in the underwater realm have staggered behind both the exploration of surface and air domains. This is due in part to the challenges that arise when placing a robot in water. One current shift has seen the use of a swarm of robots that are cheaper and are of a lower quality, that work together to accomplish a common goal, as opposed to using a single expensive robot. Swarm robotics benefits from being more tolerant of catastrophic failure and can cover large areas in smaller time frames. However, unlike other advancements in technology, underwater swarm robotics have struggled to compete with its counterparts on the surface and in the air. This is mainly due to the problems with communication underwater, the hazardous environment, the cost and difficulties with construction of underwater robots. This article conducts a literature review into the current state of underwater swarm robotics; it covers the design of the underwater robots, the methods used by the individual robot to perceive their environment, how they can localize to said environment, the methods of communication available underwater, centralized and decentralized control, the basis of swarm algorithms, the behaviors that are exhibited when a swarm works collectively and how swarms have been applied underwater.},

Further, we present the first evidence for collective memory in such animal groups (where the previous history of group structure influences the collective behaviour exhibited as individual interactions change) during the transition of a group from one type of collective behaviour to another. The model is then used to show how differences among individuals influence group structure, and how individuals employing simple, local rules of thumb, can accurately change their spatial position within a group (e.g. to move to the centre, the front, or the periphery) in the absence of information on their current position within the group as a whole.

However, available traditional economy approaches for coordination of multi-robot systems (MRS) exploration lack efficient target selection strategy under a few of situations and rely on a perfect communication. In order to overcome the shortages and endow each robot autonomy, a novel coordinated algorithm based on supervisory control of discrete event systems and a variation of the market approach is proposed in this paper. Two kinds of utility and the corresponding calculation schemes which take into account of cooperation between robots and covering the environment in a minimal time, are defined. Different moving target of each robot is determined by maximizing the corresponding utility at the lower level of the proposed hierarchical coordinated architecture. Selection of a moving target assignment strategy, dealing with communication failure, and collision avoidance are modeled as behaviors of each robot at the upper level. The proposed approach distinctly speeds up exploration process and reduces the communication requirement. The validity of our algorithm is verified by computer simulations.},

By providing individual agents with learning capabilities, CSAS can cope with challenges related to distributed sensing and decision-making and operate in uncertain environments. This unique characteristic of CSAS enables the collective to exhibit robust behaviour while achieving system-wide and agent-specific goals. Although learning has been explored in many CSAS applications, selecting suitable learning models and techniques remains a significant challenge that is heavily influenced by expert knowledge. We address this gap by performing a multifaceted analysis of existing CSAS with learning capabilities reported in the literature. Based on this analysis, we introduce a 3D framework that illustrates the learning aspects of CSAS considering the dimensions of autonomy, knowledge access, and behaviour, and facilitates the selection of learning techniques and models. Finally, using example applications from this analysis, we derive open challenges and highlight the need for research on collaborative, resilient and privacy-aware mechanisms for CSAS.},

  abstract = {The highly dynamic nature of future computing systems, where applications dynamically emerge as opportunistic aggregation of autonomous and independent resources available at any given time, requires a radical shift in the adopted computing paradigms. Indeed, they should fully reflect the decentralized perspective of the execution environment and consider QoS, scalability and resilience as key objectives. In this context, the everything-as-a-service (XaaS) paradigm, which envisions the creation of new services as an assembly of independent services available within the environment, can greatly help in tackling the challenges of developing future applications. However, in order to be effective, XaaS paradigm requires self-adaptive service assembly solutions able to cope with the unpredictable variability and scalability of the execution environment, the lack of global knowledge, and the QoS requirements of services to be built. We contribute in this direction by designing a fully decentralized and collective self-adaptive service assembly framework whose main features are: (i) self-assembly, i.e., the ability to operate autonomously, (ii) online-learning, i.e., the ability to dynamically learn from experience, (iii) QoS-awareness, i.e., the inclusion of QoS requirements as driving forces for self-assembly, (iv) scalability, i.e., the ability to cope with a large number of services, and (v) resilience, i.e., the ability to maintain the persistence of service delivery when facing unexpected changes (e.g., in the number and/or QoS of services). Simulation experiments show that our solution makes the system able to quickly converge to viable assemblies that improve and maintain over time the social welfare of the system, despite the local perspective of each participating service.},

  abstract = {Many different types of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been developed to address a variety of applications ranging from searching and mapping to surveillance. However, for complex wide-area surveillance scenarios, where fleets of autonomous UAVs must be deployed to work collectively on a common goal, multiple types of UAVs should be incorporated forming a heterogeneous UAV system. Indeed, the interconnection of two levels of UAVs---one with high altitude fixed-wing UAVs and one with low altitude rotary-wing UAVs---can provide applicability for scenarios which cannot be addressed by either UAV type. This work considers a bi-level flying ad hoc networks (FANETs), in which each UAV is equipped with ad hoc communication capabilities, in which the higher level fixed-wing swarm serves mainly as a communication bridge for the lower level UAV fleets, which conduct precise information sensing. The interconnection of multiple UAV types poses a significant challenge, since each UAV level moves according to its own mobility pattern, which is constrained by the UAV physical properties. Another important challenge is to form network clusters at the lower level, whereby the intra-level links must provide a certain degree of stability to allow a reliable communication within the UAV system. This article proposes a novel mobility model for the low-level UAVs that combines a pheromone-based model with a multi-hop clustering algorithm. The pheromones permit to focus on the least explored areas with the goal to optimize the coverage while the multi-hop clustering algorithm aims at keeping a stable and connected network. The proposed model works online and is fully distributed. The connection stability is evaluated against different measurements such as stability coefficient and volatility. The performance of the proposed model is compared to other state-of-the-art contributions using simulations. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed mobility model to significantly improve the network stability while having a limited impact on the wide-area coverage.},

Instead of dealing with a wide range of topics associated with the field, we focus on four essential topics of self-adaptation: design space for self-adaptive solutions, software engineering processes for self-adaptive systems, from centralized to decentralized control, and practical run-time verification \& validation for self-adaptive systems. For each topic, we present an overview, suggest future directions, and focus on selected challenges. This paper complements and extends a previous roadmap on software engineering for self-adaptive systems published in 2009 covering a different set of topics, and reflecting in part on the previous paper. This roadmap is one of the many results of the Dagstuhl Seminar 10431 on Software Engineering for Self-Adaptive Systems, which took place in October 2010.},

The approach was developed and analyzed on multiple robot single and multiple target search. The approach was further enhanced by the multi-robot-multi-target search in noisy environments.

  abstract = {Team oriented plans have become a popular tool for operators to control teams of autonomous robots to pursue complex objectives in complex environments. Such plans allow an operator to specify high level directives and allow the team to autonomously determine how to implement such directives. However, the operators will often want to interrupt the activities of individual team members to deal with particular situations, such as a danger to a robot that the robot team cannot perceive. Previously, after such interrupts, the operator would usually need to restart the team plan to ensure its success. In this paper, we present an approach to encoding how interrupts can be smoothly handled within a team plan. Building on a team plan formalism that uses Colored Petri Nets, we describe a mechanism that allows a range of interrupts to be handled smoothly, allowing the team to efficiently continue with its task after the operator intervention. We validate the approach with an application of robotic watercraft and show improved overall efficiency. In particular, we consider a situation where several platforms should travel through a set of pre-specified locations, and we identify three specific cases that require the operator to interrupt the plan execution: (i) a boat must be pulled out; (ii) all boats should stop the plan and move to a pre-specified assembly position; (iii) a set of boats must synchronize to traverse a dangerous area one after the other. Our experiments show that the use of our interrupt mechanism decreases the time to complete the plan (up to 48~\% reduction) and decreases the operator load (up to 80~\% reduction in number of user actions). Moreover, we performed experiments with real robotic platforms to validate the applicability of our mechanism in the actual deployment of robotic watercraft.},

We consider three versions of this problem: one where the desired direction is fixed; one where the desired direction changes over time; one where a second group of informed robots has information about a second desired direction that conflicts with the first one, but has higher priority. The goal of the swarm is to follow, at all times, the desired direction that has the highest priority and, at the same time, to keep cohesion. The proposed strategy allows the informed robots to guide the swarm when only one desired direction is present. Additionally, a self-adaptation mechanism allows the robots to indirectly sense the second desired direction, and makes the swarm follow it. In experiments with both simulated and real robots, we evaluate how well the swarm tracks the desired direction and how well it maintains cohesion. We show that, using self-adaptive communication, the swarm is able to follow the desired direction with the highest priority at all times without splitting.},

To evaluate their generality, in this paper we test them without any modification on five new tasks. Besides confirming that vanilla is effective, our results provide new insight into the design of robot swarms. In particular, our results indicate that, at least under the adopted experimental protocol, not only does automatic design suffer from the reality gap, but also manual design. The results also show that both manual and automatic methods benefit from bias injection. In this work, bias injection consists in restricting the design search space to the combinations of pre-existing modules. The results indicate that bias injection helps to overcome the reality gap, yielding better performing robot swarms.},

Using a tool-based approximation of the work-area, we present an algorithm that covers every point of the approximate area. The algorithm, called spanning tree covering (STC), subdivides the work-area into disjoint cells corresponding to the square-shaped tool, then follows a spanning tree of the graph induced by the cells, while covering every point precisely once. We present and analyze three versions of the STC algorithm. The first version is an off-line algorithm that computes an optimal covering path in linear time O(N), where N is the number of cells comprising the approximate area. The second version is an online or sensor based algorithm, that completes an optimal covering path in time O(N), but requires O(N) memory for its implementation. The third version of STC is "ant"-like, where the robot may leave pheromone-like markers during the coverage process. The ant-like STC algorithm runs in time O(N) and requires only O(1) memory. We present simulation results of the three STC algorithms, demonstrating their effectiveness in cases where the tool size is significantly smaller than the work-area characteristic dimension.},

For single robot coverage path planning (CPP) problem, an improved ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is proposed to construct the best spanning tree and then obtain the optimal path, which contributes to minimizing the energy/time consumption. For the multirobot case, first the DARP (Divide Areas based on Robots Initial Positions) algorithm is utilized to divide the area into separate equal subareas, so much so that it transforms the mCPP problem into several CPP problems, degrading the computation complexity. During the second phase, spanning tree in each subarea is constructed by the aforementioned algorithm. In the last phase, the specific end nodes are exchanged among subareas to achieve ideal-shaped spanning trees, which can also decrease the number of turns in coverage path. And the complete algorithms are proven to be approximately polynomial algorithms. Finally, the simulation confirms the complete algorithms' advantages: complete coverage, nonbacktracks, minimum length, zero preparation time, and the least number of turns.},

From the routing of traffic in telecommunication networks to the design of control algorithms for groups of autonomous robots, the collective behaviors of these animals have inspired many of the foundational works in this emerging research field. For the first issue of this journal dedicated to swarm intelligence, we review the main biological principles that underlie the organization of insects' colonies. We begin with some reminders about the decentralized nature of such systems and we describe the underlying mechanisms of complex collective behaviors of social insects, from the concept of stigmergy to the theory of self-organization in biological systems. We emphasize in particular the role of interactions and the importance of bifurcations that appear in the collective output of the colony when some of the system's parameters change. We then propose to categorize the collective behaviors displayed by insect colonies according to four functions that emerge at the level of the colony and that organize its global behavior. Finally, we address the role of modulations of individual behaviors by disturbances (either environmental or internal to the colony) in the overall flexibility of insect colonies. We conclude that future studies about self-organized biological behaviors should investigate such modulations to better understand how insect colonies adapt to uncertain worlds.},

With the goal of bringing objective grounding to this important area of research, we present a formal study of MRTA problems. A domain-independent taxonomy of MRTA problems is given, and it is shown how many such problems can be viewed as instances of other, well-studied, optimization problems. We demonstrate how relevant theory from operations research and combinatorial optimization can be used for analysis and greater understanding of existing approaches to task allocation, and to show how the same theory can be used in the synthesis of new approaches.},

While these characteristics are typical of various disaster response and commercial applications, there is a lack of online MRTA solutions to address them. To solve this class of complex MRTA problems, an efficient online method (which is also suitable for decentralized deployment) is developed based on the construction and weighted matching of bipartite graphs. An exact integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of this class of MRTA problems is also developed, the solution of which serves both as an offline MRTA approach and as a provably optimal benchmark against which the online method is compared. The new methods are applied to a flood response problem where multiple unmanned aerial vehicles must respond to victims spread out over a large area. The results show that the new online algorithm closely trails the offline ILP method in terms of task completion performance, while being {$>$}103 times more computationally efficient compared to the ILP method. Dedicated case studies provide further insights into the favorable scalability of the online method with an increasing number of UAVs --- offering up to 46\% higher task completion compared to a random walk baseline in huge 1000-task problems. Lastly, application to a slightly different class of SR--ST problems and comparison of the ensuing results with that of corresponding state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the potential wider applicability of the proposed online MRTA method.},

  abstract = {Recently, we have been witnessing a rapid increase in the use of machine learning techniques in self-adaptive systems. Machine learning has been used for a variety of reasons, ranging from learning a model of the environment of a system during operation to filtering large sets of possible configurations before analyzing them. While a body of work on the use of machine learning in self-adaptive systems exists, there is currently no systematic overview of this area. Such an overview is important for researchers to understand the state of the art and direct future research efforts. This article reports the results of a systematic literature review that aims at providing such an overview. We focus on self-adaptive systems that are based on a traditional Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute (MAPE)-based feedback loop. The research questions are centered on the problems that motivate the use of machine learning in self-adaptive systems, the key engineering aspects of learning in self-adaptation, and open challenges in this area. The search resulted in 6,709 papers, of which 109 were retained for data collection. Analysis of the collected data shows that machine learning is mostly used for updating adaptation rules and policies to improve system qualities, and managing resources to better balance qualities and resources. These problems are primarily solved using supervised and interactive learning with classification, regression, and reinforcement learning as the dominant methods. Surprisingly, unsupervised learning that naturally fits automation is only applied in a small number of studies. Key open challenges in this area include the performance of learning, managing the effects of learning, and dealing with more complex types of goals. From the insights derived from this systematic literature review, we outline an initial design process for applying machine learning in self-adaptive systems that are based on MAPE feedback loops.},

We report on experiments in which we study the process that leads a group of s-bots to self-assemble. In particular, we present results of experiments in which we vary the number of s-bots (up to 16 physical robots), their starting configurations, and the properties of the terrain on which self-assembly takes place. In view of the very successful experimental results, swarm-bot qualifies as the current state of the art in autonomous self-assembly},

Motivated by potential efficiency and robustness improvements, there is growing interest in the use of multiple robots in coverage. Previous investigations of multi-robot coverage focuses on completeness and eliminating redundancy, but does not formally address robustness, nor examine the impact of the initial positions of robots on the coverage time. Indeed, a common assumption is that non-redundancy leads to improved coverage time. We address robustness and efficiency in a family of multi-robot coverage algorithms, based on spanning-tree coverage of approximate cell decomposition. We analytically show that the algorithms are robust, in that as long as a single robot is able to move, the coverage will be completed. We also show that non-redundant (non-back tracking) versions of the algorithms have a worst-case coverage time virtually identical to that of a single robot---thus no performance gain is guaranteed in non-redundant coverage. Moreover, this worst-case is in fact common in real-world applications. Surprisingly, however, redundant coverage algorithms lead to guaranteed performance which halves the coverage time even in the worst case.},

This algorithm continually plans a path that allows the MAV to fulfil two objectives at the same time while avoiding obstacles: observe as much unexplored space as possible, and observe as much of the surface of the environment as possible given viewing angle and distance constraints. The former and latter objectives are known as the exploration and coverage problems respectively. Our algorithm is particularly useful for automated 3D reconstruction at the street level and in indoor environments where obstacles are omnipresent. By solving the exploration problem, we maximize the size of the reconstructed model. By solving the coverage problem, we maximize the completeness of the model. Our algorithm leverages the state lattice concept such that the planned path adheres to specified motion constraints. Furthermore, our algorithm is computationally efficient and able to run on-board the MAV in real-time. We assume that the MAV is equipped with a forward-looking depth-sensing camera in the form of either a stereo camera or RGB-D camera. We use simulation experiments to validate our algorithm. In addition, we show that our algorithm achieves a significantly higher level of coverage as compared to an exploration-only approach while still allowing the MAV to fully explore the environment.},

We identify a number of security challenges for swarm robotics and argue that now is the right time to address these issues and seek solutions. We also identify several idiosyncrasies of swarm robotics that present some unique security challenges. In particular, swarms of robots potentially (i) employ different types of communication channels (ii) have special concepts of identity, and (iii) exhibit adaptive emergent behaviour which could be modified by an intruder. Addressing these issues now will prevent undesirable consequences for many applications of this type of technology.},

  abstract = {Many structures built by social insects are the outcome of a process of self-organization, in which the repeated actions of the insects interact over time with the changing physical environment to produce a characteristic end state. A major mediating factor is stigmergy, the elicitation of specific environment-changing behaviors by the sensory effects of local environmental changes produced by previous behavior. A typical task involving stigmergic self-organization is brood sorting: Many ant species sort their brood so that items at similar stages of development are grouped together and separated from items at different stages of development. This article examines the operation of stigmergy and self-organization in a homogeneous group of physical robots, in the context of the task of clustering and sorting Frisbees of two different types. Using a behavioral rule set simpler than any yet proposed for ant sorting, and having no capacity for spatial orientation or memory, the robots are able to achieve effective clustering and sorting showing all the signs of self-organization. It is argued that the success of this demonstration is crucially dependent on the exploitation of real-world physics, and that the use of simulation alone to investigate stigmergy may fail to reveal its power as an evolutionary option for collective life forms.},

A mobile sensor network is composed of a distributed collection of nodes, each of which has sensing, computation, communication and locomotion capabilities. Such networks are capable of self-deployment; i.e., starting from some compact initial configuration, the nodes in the network can spread out such that the area `covered' by the network is maximized. In this paper, we present a potential-field-based approach to deployment. The fields are constructed such that each node is repelled by both obstacles and by other nodes, thereby forcing the network to spread itself throughout the environment. The approach is both distributed and scalable.},

This technique has earned significant research interest due to its usefulness in search and rescue, fault detection and monitoring, localization and mapping, etc. In this paper, a novel cooperative exploration strategy is proposed for multiple mobile robots, which reduces the overall task completion time and energy costs compared to conventional methods. To efficiently navigate the networked robots during the collaborative tasks, a hierarchical control architecture is designed which contains a high-level decision making layer and a low-level target tracking layer. The proposed cooperative exploration approach is developed using dynamic Voronoi partitions, which minimizes duplicated exploration areas by assigning different target locations to individual robots. To deal with sudden obstacles in the unknown environment, an integrated deep reinforcement learning based collision avoidance algorithm is then proposed, which enables the control policy to learn from human demonstration data and thus improve the learning speed and performance. Finally, simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

Verification tools, correspondingly, have been developed to check properties of these systems.

In this work we present an extensible framework that leverages mainstream verification tools to successfully reason about various types of properties. We describe the verification of models specified in the Brahms agent modeling language to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. We chose Brahms because it is used to model real instances of interactions between pilots, air-traffic controllers, and automated systems at NASA. Our framework takes as input a Brahms model along with a Java implementation of its semantics. We then use Java PathFinder to explore all possible behaviors of the model and, also, produce a generalized intermediate representation that encodes these behaviors. The intermediate representation is automatically transformed to the input language of mainstream model checkers, including PRISM, SPIN, and NuSMV allowing us to check different types of properties. We validate our approach on a model that contains key elements from the Air France Flight 447 accident.},

With an appropriate level of human control, swarm systems could be applied in a variety of contexts ranging from urban search and rescue situations to cyber defence. However, the successful deployment of the swarm in such applications is conditioned by the effective coupling between human and swarm. While adaptive autonomy promises to provide enhanced performance in human-machine interaction, distinct factors must be considered for its implementation within human-swarm interaction. This paper reviews the multidisciplinary literature on different aspects contributing to the facilitation of adaptive autonomy in human-swarm interaction. Specifically, five aspects that are necessary for an adaptive agent to operate properly are considered and discussed, including mission objectives, interaction, mission complexity, automation levels, and human states. We distill the corresponding indicators in each of the five aspects, and propose a framework, named MICAH (i.e., Mission-Interaction-Complexity-Automation-Human), which maps the primitive state indicators needed for adaptive human-swarm teaming.},

We study this effect in swarms in the context of a resource foraging task. We simulate the evolution of swarms gathering energy from a number of energy sources distributed in a two-dimensional environment. As the number of sources increases, the evolution of the swarm results in reduced levels of efficiency, despite the sources covering more space. Our results indicate that this effect arises because the simultaneous detection of multiple sources is incompatible with an evolutionary scheme that favours greedy energy consumption. In particular, the communication among the agents tends to reduce their efficiency by precluding the evolution of a clear preference for an increasing number of options. The overabundance of explicit information in the swarm about fitness-related options cannot be exploited by the agents lacking complex planning capabilities. If the sensor ranges evolve in addition to the behaviour of the agents, a preference for reduced choice results, and the average range approaches zero as the number of sources increases. Our study thus presents a minimal model for the paradox of choice, which implies several options of experimental verification.},

The developed strategy adopts the learning capabilities of BELBIC with the flocking that makes it a very promising approach, especially while dealing with system uncertainties and/or unknown disturbances. Furthermore, the low computational complexity of the designed method makes it very suitable for practical implementation in real-time applications. Eventually, the effectiveness of the developed intelligent resilient distributed flocking control approach is demonstrated through the several simulation scenarios.},

  abstract = {Environmental monitoring is one of the main societal challenge of the last century. This is particularly important when considering the increasing population growth and the industrialization of developing countries. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and robotics can play a significant role in this perspective as they offer invaluable tools to continuously gather relevant information over wide, possibly dangerous areas. In particular autonomous boats hold great promises for monitoring water bodies (lakes, rivers, fishfarms) or providing first aid in floods. However, a key feature for such systems to have a practical impact on society is to provide accurate measures over large areas while being cost effective. In this work, we focus on a water monitoring system, based on Cooperative Robotic Watercrafts (CRW), commercialised by Platypus LLC . The CRW approach is based on the use of low cost, small, robotics platforms, which are able to interact with each other and make use of various artificial intelligence methods to ensure a significant level of autonomy for navigation and information gathering tasks. Figure 1(a) shows a differential drive propeller versions. In addition to a battery based propulsion mechanism, each boat is equipped with an Android OS smartphone, custom electronics board, and sensor payload. The Android smartphone provides communication, GPS, compass, and multi-core processor. The Arduino Mega based electronics board receives commands from the Android phone and interfaces with the propulsion mechanism and sensor payload, as shown in Figure 1(b). The electronics board supports a wide variety of devices including acoustic doppler current profilers and sensors that measure temperature, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), and pH level. A crucial aspect for the CRW is the high level of autonomy of the platforms, which can be controlled by few human operators that provide high level instructions to the system. In particular, Figure 1(c) shows the Graphical User Interface that the human operators can use to control the robotic platforms. Boats behaviors are expressed in the form of high level plan encoded as Colored Petri Nets [1]. In this example, the human operator activated an explore area plan providing the shape of the area that must be explored. The platforms will then automatically divide the area in different sections and execute a pre-specified strategy to monitor the area. Figure 1(d) shows an example of the standard lawnmower strategy employed by the boats. Notice that such strategy is decided off-line, i.e., before the system acquires any readings, and as such it does not depend on the data that the platforms are collecting.},

Successful solutions to forming pickup teams would enable researchers to experiment with larger numbers of robots and enable industry to efficiently and cost-effectively integrate new robot technology with existing legacy teams.

We build on prior approaches in market-based task allocation and plays for synchronized task execution, to allocate roles amongst robots in the pickup team, and to execute synchronized team actions to accomplish the treasure hunt task},

In previous research on dynamic pricing algorithms, each seller's pricebot employs either heuristics-based or learning-based techniques to determine and update the profit maximizing price for itself at certain intervals in response to changes in market dynamics. In these dynamic pricing techniques, each seller's pricebot uses only its private information such as past prices and profits to update its price in successive intervals. In this paper, we posit that the profits obtained by a pricebot can be improved if each pricebot incorporates its competitors' pricing information along with its private price and profit information in its price-update calculations. However, incorporating competitors' pricing information accurately into a pricebot's dynamic pricing algorithm is a challenging problem because competing sellers (pricebots) update their prices asynchronously and by an amount determined by each seller's private pricing strategy. Our contribution in this paper is a novel dynamic pricing algorithm that uses a distributed synchronization model observed in nature to align each seller's price with its competitors' prices. Our analytical and simulation results show that the combination of a heuristics-based pricing mechanism that uses only a seller's private information and the synchronization-based mechanism that aligns its prices with its competitors, enables a seller's pricebot to improve its profits by as much as 78\% as compared to previous dynamic pricing algorithms.},

However, little work has been devoted to port the exploration capabilities of robot swarms into the context of mapping. Indeed, conceiving robot swarms that can map an unknown environment in a robust, scalable, and flexible way is an open issue. In this paper, we investigate a swarm mapping method in which robots first individually map the environment by random walk and then, we merge their maps into a single, global one. We focus on five variants of random walk and we compare the quality of the maps that a swarm produces when exploring the environment using these variants. Our experiments with ten e-puck robots show that, despite the individual maps being incomplete by themselves, it is possible to collectively map the environment by merging them. We found that the quality of the map depends on the exploration behavior of the individuals. Our results suggest that one of the variants of random walk, the ballistic motion, gives better mapping results for closed environments.},

These characteristics allow robot swarms to achieve scalability, flexibility and fault tolerance, properties that are especially valuable in the context of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), specifically in unknown environments that evolve over time. So far, research in SLAM has mainly focused on single- and centralized multi-robot systems---i.e., non-swarm systems. While these systems can produce accurate maps, they are typically not scalable, cannot easily adapt to unexpected changes in the environment, and are prone to failure in hostile environments. Swarm SLAM is a promising approach to SLAM as it could leverage the decentralized nature of a robot swarm and achieve scalable, flexible and fault-tolerant exploration and mapping. However, at the moment of writing, swarm SLAM is a rather novel idea and the field lacks definitions, frameworks, and results. In this work, we present the concept of swarm SLAM and its constraints, both from a technical and an economical point of view. In particular, we highlight the main challenges of swarm SLAM for gathering, sharing, and retrieving information. We also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this approach against traditional multi-robot SLAM. We believe that swarm SLAM will be particularly useful to produce abstract maps such as topological or simple semantic maps and to operate under time or cost constraints.},

  abstract = {Multi-robot systems (MRS) are a group of robots that are designed aiming to perform some collective behavior. By this collective behavior, some goals that are impossible for a single robot to achieve become feasible and attainable. There are several foreseen benefits of MRS compared to single robot systems such as the increased ability to resolve task complexity, increasing performance, reliability and simplicity in design. These benefits have attracted many researchers from academia and industry to investigate how to design and develop robust versatile MRS by solving a number of challenging problems such as complex task allocation, group formation, cooperative object detection and tracking, communication relaying and self-organization to name just a few. One of the most challenging problems of MRS is how to optimally assign a set of robots to a set of tasks in such a way that optimizes the overall system performance subject to a set of constraints. This problem is known as Multi-robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem. MRTA is a complex problem especially when it comes to heterogeneous unreliable robots equipped with different capabilities that are required to perform various tasks with different requirements and constraints in an optimal way. This chapter provides a comprehensive review on challenging aspects of MRTA problem, recent approaches to tackle this problem and the future directions.},

Collision avoidance, tradi tionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, al lowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. This method has been extended to moving obstacles by using a time-varying artificial patential field. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm mechanisms and have used a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator con trol problem as direct control of manipulator motion in oper ational space---the space in which the task is originally described---rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kine matic transformation. Outside the obstacles' regions of influ ence, we caused the end effector to move in a straight line with an upper speed limit. The artificial potential field ap proach has been extended to collision avoidance for all ma nipulator links. In addition, a joint space artificial potential field is used to satisfy the manipulator internal joint con straints. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed by using visual sensing.},

  abstract = {Ant robots are simple creatures with limited sensing and computational capabilities. They have the advantage that they are easy to program and cheap to build. This makes it feasible to deploy groups of ant robots and take advantage of the resulting fault tolerance and parallelism. We study, both theoretically and in simulation, the behavior of ant robots for one-time or repeated coverage of terrain, as required for lawn mowing, mine sweeping, and surveillance. Ant robots cannot use conventional planning methods due to their limited sensing and computational capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we study navigation methods that are based on real-time (heuristic) search and leave markings in the terrain, similar to what real ants do. These markings can be sensed by all ant robots and allow them to cover terrain even if they do not communicate with each other except via the markings, do not have any kind of memory, do not know the terrain, cannot maintain maps of the terrain, nor plan complete paths. The ant robots do not even need to be localized, which completely eliminates solving difficult and time-consuming localization problems. We study two simple real-time search methods that differ only in how the markings are updated. We show experimentally that both real-time search methods robustly cover terrain even if the ant robots are moved without realizing this (say, by people running into them), some ant robots fail, and some markings get destroyed. Both real-time search methods are algorithmically similar, and our experimental results indicate that their cover time is similar in some terrains. Our analysis is therefore surprising. We show that the cover time of ant robots that use one of the real-time search methods is guaranteed to be polynomial in the number of locations, whereas the cover time of ant robots that use the other real-time search method can be exponential in (the square root of) the number of locations even in simple terrains that correspond to (planar) undirected trees.},

Remote sensing technology is increasingly used to assess changes in forest cover, species distributions and carbon stocks. However, satellite and airborne sensors can be prohibitively costly and inaccessible for researchers in developing countries. Here, we describe the development and use of an inexpensive ({$<\$$}2,000) unmanned aerial vehicle for surveying and mapping forests and biodiversity (referred to as `Conservation Drone' hereafter). Our prototype drone is able to fly pre-programmed missions autonomously for a total flight time of {\textasciitilde}25 minutes and over a distance of {\textasciitilde}15 km. Non-technical operators can program each mission by defining waypoints along a flight path using an open-source software. This drone can record videos at up to 1080 pixel resolution (high definition), and acquire aerial photographs of {$<$}10 cm pixel resolution. Aerial photographs can be stitched together to produce real-time geo-referenced land use/cover maps of surveyed areas. We evaluate the performance of this prototype Conservation Drone based on a series of test flights in Aras Napal, Sumatra, Indonesia. We discuss the further development of Conservation Drone 2.0, which will have a bigger payload and longer range. Initial tests suggest a flight time of {\textasciitilde}50 minutes and a range of {\textasciitilde}25 km. Finally, we highlight the potential of this system for environmental and conservation applications, which include near real-time mapping of local land cover, monitoring of illegal forest activities, and surveying of large animal species.},

  abstract = {Task allocation is an important aspect of many multi-robot systems. The features and complexity of multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problems are dictated by the requirements of the particular domain under consideration. These problems can range from those involving instantaneous distribution of simple, independent tasks among members of a homogenous team, to those requiring the time-extended scheduling of complex interrelated multi-step tasks for members of a heterogenous team related by several constraints. The existing widely used taxonomy for task allocation in multi-robot systems was designed for problems with independent tasks and does not deal with problems with interrelated utilities and constraints. While that taxonomy was a ground-breaking contribution to the MRTA literature, a survey of recent work in MRTA reveals that it is no longer a sufficient taxonomy, due to the increasing importance of interrelated utilities and constraints in realistic MRTA problems under consideration. Thus, in this paper, we present a new, comprehensive taxonomy, iTax, that explicitly takes into consideration the issues of interrelated utilities and constraints. Our taxonomy maps categories of MRTA problems to existing mathematical models from combinatorial optimization and operations research, and hence draws important parallels between robotics and these fields.},

Our mechanisms, used to invoke the group behavior, allow the system of robots to perform tasks without centralized control or explicit communication. We have constructed a system of five mobile robots capable of achieving simple collective tasks to verify the results obtained in simulation. The results suggest that decentralized control without explicit communication can be used to perform cooperative tasks requiring a collective behavior.},

  abstract = {Several position identification methods are being used for mobile robots. Dead reckoning is a popular method but due to the error accumulation from wheel slippage, its reliability is low for measurement of long distances especially on uneven surfaces. Another popular method is the landmark method, which estimates current position relative to known landmarks, but the landmark method's limitation is that it cannot be used in an uncharted environment. Thus, this paper proposes a new method called ``Cooperative Positioning System (CPS)'' that is able to overcome these shortcomings. The main concept of CPS is to divide the robots into two groups, A and B where group A remains stationary and acts as a landmark while group B moves and then group B stops and acts as a landmark for group A. This process is repeated until the target position is reached. Compared with dead reckoning, CPS has a far lower accumulation of positioning errors, and can also work in three dimensions. Furthermore, CPS employs inherent landmarks and therefore can be used in uncharted environments unlike the landmark method. In this paper, we introduce the basic concept of CPS and its positioning principle. Next, we outline a second prototype CPS machine model (CPS-II) and discuss the method of position estimation using the variance of positioning error and weighted least squares method. Position identification experiments using the CPS-II model give a positioning accuracy of 0.12\% for position and 0.32 degree for attitude after the robots traveled a distance of 21.5 m.},

Their effectiveness in accomplishing these tasks rests upon the design of cooperative control strategies, which is acknowledged to be challenging and nontrivial. In particular, the effectiveness of these strategies has been shown to be related to the so-called exploration--exploitation dilemma: i.e., the existence of a distinct balance between exploitative actions and exploratory ones while the system is operating. Recent results point to the need for a dynamic exploration--exploitation balance to unlock high levels of flexibility, adaptivity, and swarm intelligence. This important point is especially apparent when dealing with fast-changing environments. Problems involving dynamic environments have been dealt with by different scientific communities using theory, simulations, as well as large-scale experiments. Such results spread across a range of disciplines can hinder one's ability to understand and manage the intricacies of the exploration--exploitation challenge. In this review, we summarize and categorize the methods used to control the level of exploration and exploitation carried out by an multi-agent systems. Lastly, we discuss the critical need for suitable metrics and benchmark problems to quantitatively assess and compare the levels of exploration and exploitation, as well as the overall performance of a system with a given cooperative control algorithm.},

While most conventional approaches strive to reduce path overlaps, this work focuses on smoothing the coverage path to reduce accelerations and yet to increase the average velocity for faster coverage. The proposed algorithm adopts a high-resolution grid map representation to reduce directional constraints on path generation. Here, the free space is covered by three independent behaviors: spiral path tracking, wall following control, and virtual wall path tracking. Regarding the covered region as a virtual wall, all the three behaviors adopt a common strategy of following the (physical or virtual) wall or obstacle boundaries for close coverage. Wall following is executed by a sensor-based reactive path planning control process, whereas the spiral (filling) path and virtual wall path are first modeled by their relevant parametric curves and then tracked via dynamic feedback linearization. For complete coverage, these independent behaviors are linked through a new path linking strategy, called a coarse-to-fine constrained inverse distance transform (CFCIDT). CFCIDT reduces the computational cost compared to the conventional constrained inverse distance transform (CIDT), which applies a region growing starting from the current robot position to find the nearest unexplored cell as well as the shortest path to it while constraining the search space. As for experimental validation, performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to those of conventional coverage techniques to demonstrate its completeness of coverage, energy and time efficiency, and robustness to the environment shape or the initial robot pose.},

The proposed approach consists of two algorithms, namely, resource-aware cost generation (RCG) and ad hoc network-based task allocation (ANTA). The RCG algorithm allows each robot to generate a credible cost of task performance considering its residual resources in task planning. The ANTA algorithm constructs the minimal spanning tree network among the robots and determines the robot with the lowest cost for the task through multihop communication in a decentralized manner. The advantages of the proposed approach are minimization of unnecessary task performance cost caused by resource shortage of robots during task execution and the use of an ad hoc network among the robots to allow more robots to participate in the task allocation process. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through computer simulations for multirobot foraging as a test problem.},

Next, two forms of dynamic heterogeneity are investigated: nonadaptive mixed strategies and adaptive strategies, which learn online. Our second contribution is to show that mixed strategies offer Pareto efficiency consistently comparable with the most efficient static heterogeneous configurations. Since the particular configuration required for high Pareto efficiency in a scenario will not be known in advance, our third contribution is to show how decentralized online learning can lead to more efficient outcomes than the homogeneous case. In some cases, outcomes from online learning were more efficient than all other evaluated configuration types. Our fourth contribution is to show that online learning typically leads to outcomes more evenly spread over the objective space.

  abstract = {The aim of the Smart and Networking Underwater Robots in Cooperation Meshes (SWARMs) project is to make autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), remote operated vehicles (ROVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) more accessible and useful. To achieve cooperation and communication between different AUVs, these must be able to exchange messages, so an efficient and reliable communication network is necessary for SWARMs. In order to provide an efficient and reliable communication network for mission execution, one of the important and necessary issues is the topology control of the network of AUVs that are cooperating underwater. However, due to the specific properties of an underwater AUV cooperation network, such as the high mobility of AUVs, large transmission delays, low bandwidth, etc., the traditional topology control algorithms primarily designed for terrestrial wireless sensor networks cannot be used directly in the underwater environment. Moreover, these algorithms, in which the nodes adjust their transmission power once the current transmission power does not equal an optimal one, are costly in an underwater cooperating AUV network. Considering these facts, in this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Topology Control (PTC) algorithm for an underwater cooperating AUV network. In PTC, when the transmission power of an AUV is not equal to the optimal transmission power, then whether the transmission power needs to be adjusted or not will be determined based on the AUV's parameters. Each AUV determines their own transmission power adjustment probability based on the parameter deviations. The larger the deviation, the higher the transmission power adjustment probability is, and vice versa. For evaluating the performance of PTC, we combine the PTC algorithm with the Fuzzy logic Topology Control (FTC) algorithm and compare the performance of these two algorithms. The simulation results have demonstrated that the PTC is efficient at reducing the transmission power adjustment ratio while improving the network performance.},

  abstract = {The discrepancy between simulation and reality--known as the reality gap--is one of the main challenges associated with using simulations to design control software for robot swarms. Currently, the reality-gap problem necessitates expensive and time consuming tests on physical robots to reliably assess control software. Predicting real-world performance accurately without recurring to physical experiments would be particularly valuable. In this paper, we compare various simulation-based predictors of the performance of robot swarms that have been proposed in the literature but never evaluated empirically. We consider (1) the classical approach adopted to estimate real-world performance, which relies on the evaluation of control software on the simulation model used in the design process, and (2) some so-called pseudo-reality predictors, which rely on simulation models other than the one used in the design process. To evaluate these predictors, we reuse 1021 instances of control software and their real-world performance gathered from seven previous studies. Results show that the pseudo-reality predictors considered yield more accurate estimates of the real-world performance than the classical approach.},

Cooperative autonomous driving is an effective solution to reduce traffic congestion and ensure traffic safety. In this paper, cooperative autonomous control of multiple vehicles is considered to realize sharing the same roads without collusion with each other. Lane-following and braking control are two basic operations of cooperative driving. The objectives of lane-following are to make inter vehicles keep a safe spacing and run on the middle position of a lane. To reach the targets, two distributed control protocols are proposed in which we consider not only lateral control but also longitudinal control. The stability analysis is also shown for both the control protocols. Braking control is another basic operation for autonomous cooperative control. In order to make vehicles stop at the desired target stopping position (TSP), a new braking control protocol is also designed, and the convergence of which is analyzed and shown that, under three kinds of distinct braking control parameters, the position of the mass center of all vehicles exponentially converges to the TSP, and the velocity of the mass center of all vehicles exponentially converges to zero, which provide a guide for selecting the braking control parameters in real engineering applications. Moreover, the initial and limit conditions of position and velocity are discussed. Simulations demonstrate the validity and superiority of the proposed control protocols compared with existing approaches.},

We generalize existing complexity results of (offline) MAPF to online MAPF. We classify online MAPF algorithms into different categories based on (1) controllability (the set of agents that they can plan paths for at each time) and (2) rationality (the quality of paths they plan) and study the relationships between them. We perform a competitive analysis for each category of online MAPF algorithms with respect to commonly-used objective functions. We show that a naive algorithm that routes newly-revealed agents one at a time in sequence achieves a competitive ratio that is asymptotically bounded from both below and above by the number of agents with respect to flowtime and makespan. We then show a counter-intuitive result that, if rerouting of previously-revealed agents is not allowed, any rational online MAPF algorithms, including ones that plan optimal paths for all newly-revealed agents, have the same asymptotic competitive ratio as the naive algorithm, even on 2D 4-neighbor grids. We also derive constant lower bounds on the competitive ratio of any rational online MAPF algorithms that allow rerouting. The results thus provide theoretical insights into the effectiveness of using MAPF algorithms in an online setting for the first time.},

  abstract = {To secure uninterrupted distribution of electricity, effective monitoring and maintenance of power lines are needed. This literature review article aims to give a wide overview of the possibilities provided by modern remote sensing sensors in power line corridor surveys and to discuss the potential and limitations of different approaches. Monitoring of both power line components and vegetation around them is included. Remotely sensed data sources discussed in the review include synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, optical satellite and aerial images, thermal images, airborne laser scanner (ALS) data, land-based mobile mapping data, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data. The review shows that most previous studies have concentrated on the mapping and analysis of network components. In particular, automated extraction of power line conductors has achieved much attention, and promising results have been reported. For example, accuracy levels above 90\% have been presented for the extraction of conductors from ALS data or aerial images. However, in many studies datasets have been small and numerical quality analyses have been omitted. Mapping of vegetation near power lines has been a less common research topic than mapping of the components, but several studies have also been carried out in this field, especially using optical aerial and satellite images. Based on the review we conclude that in future research more attention should be given to an integrated use of various data sources to benefit from the various techniques in an optimal way. Knowledge in related fields, such as vegetation monitoring from ALS, SAR and optical image data should be better exploited to develop useful monitoring approaches. Special attention should be given to rapidly developing remote sensing techniques such as UAVs and laser scanning from airborne and land-based platforms. To demonstrate and verify the capabilities of automated monitoring approaches, large tests in various environments and practical monitoring conditions are needed. These should include careful quality analyses and comparisons between different data sources, methods and individual algorithms.},

MoPs and MoEs at the swarm level may be regarded as driven by characteristics of the network as a whole.

The present study compared differences in MoPs that underlie the effective performance of 30-UAV swarms using simulation experimentation method in a search and rescue mission scenario. Thirty different swarm configurations were composed by varying percentages of entities with one of three different operational behaviors relevant to a search and rescue mission (Social Searcher, Relay, Anti-Social Searcher). Except for the search behaviors, the UAVs were identical in function. Results indicated significant differences in time-to-mission-completion (MoE) among the 30 configurations. Statistical analyses revealed significant differences in network metric MoPs; that is, the best performing swarm configuration had a greater number of communication linkages and faster speed of communication pathways through the swarm network.},

  abstract = {Swarm robotic systems comprise many individual robots, and exhibit a degree of innate fault tolerance due to this built-in redundancy. They are robust in the sense that the complete failure of individual robots will have little detrimental effect on a swarm's overall collective behaviour. However, it has recently been shown that partially failed individuals may be harmful, and cause problems that cannot be solved by simply adding more robots to the swarm. Instead, an active approach to dealing with failed individuals is required for a swarm to continue operation in the face of partial failures. This thesis presents a novel method of exogenous fault detection that allows robots to detect the presence of faults in each other, via the comparison of expected and observed behaviour. Each robot predicts the expected behaviour of its neighbours by simulating them online in an internal replica of the real world. This expected behaviour is then compared against observations of their true behaviour, and any significant discrepancy is detected as a fault. This work represents the first step towards a distributed fault detection, diagnosis, and recovery process that would afford robot swarms a high degree of fault tolerance, and facilitate long-term autonomy.},

In addition, finding the right level of abstraction to represent any generic MAS mission is important for being able to provide general solution to the automated planning problem. In this article, we show how a mission for heterogeneous MASs can be cast as an extension of the traveling salesperson problem (TSP), and we propose a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. In order to solve this problem, a genetic mission planner (GMP), with a local plan refinement algorithm, is proposed. In addition, the comparative evaluation of CPLEX and GMP is presented in terms of timing and optimality of the obtained solutions. The algorithms are benchmarked on a proposed set of different problem instances.

Four types of grey wolves such as alpha, beta, delta, and omega are employed for simulating the leadership hierarchy. In addition, the three main steps of hunting, searching for prey, encircling prey, and attacking prey, are implemented. The algorithm is then benchmarked on 29 well-known test functions, and the results are verified by a comparative study with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary Programming (EP), and Evolution Strategy (ES). The results show that the GWO algorithm is able to provide very competitive results compared to these well-known meta-heuristics. The paper also considers solving three classical engineering design problems (tension/compression spring, welded beam, and pressure vessel designs) and presents a real application of the proposed method in the field of optical engineering.

  abstract = {The Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) is a promising approach for modeling distributed reasoning tasks that arise in multiagent systems. Unfortunately, existing methods for DCOP are not able to provide theoretical guarantees on global solution quality while allowing agents to operate asynchronously. We show how this failure can be remedied by allowing agents to make local decisions based on conservative cost estimates rather than relying on global certainty as previous approaches have done. This novel approach results in a polynomial-space algorithm for DCOP named Adopt that is guaranteed to find the globally optimal solution while allowing agents to execute asynchronously and in parallel. Detailed experimental results show that on benchmark problems Adopt obtains speedups of several orders of magnitude over other approaches. Adopt can also perform bounded-error approximation---it has the ability to quickly find approximate solutions and, unlike heuristic search methods, still maintain a theoretical guarantee on solution quality.},

We use a continuous double-auction to allow applications to decide which services to choose, among the many on offer. We view an application as a multi-agent system and the cloud as a marketplace where many such applications self-adapt. We show through a simulation study that our mechanism is effective for the individual application as well as from the collective perspective of all applications adapting at the same time.},

  abstract = {Swarm Robotics (SR) is an extension of the study of Multi-Robot Systems that exploits concepts of communication, coordination and collaboration among a large number of robots. The massive parallelization yielded by the robots working together can make a task faster than in the case of the usage of a single complex robot. One of the main aspects in robotic swarms is that the control is decentralized by definition and distributed among the robots of the swarm, improving the system robustness and fault-tolerance. Furthermore, this characteristic often allows the emergence of collective behaviors from the robot's interaction with each other and with the environment through their embodied sensors and actuators. In most cases, the number of inputs from sensor readings turns analytical solutions hard or even impossible. Thus, many ad-hoc approaches are contributed to deal with the situation at hand. The main goal of this review is to find out, through the study of existing research works of the field, the reason behind the lack of exploitation of swarm robotic systems in real-world applications. For this purpose, we first review the different possibilities of study in SR: physical and simulated robotic platforms, development methodologies and the variety of basic tasks and collective behaviors. We then briefly describe some fields related do SR that have a big impact on the development of SR. After that, based on existing taxonomies found in literature, we categorize existing research works regarding SR in two large main groups: those that deal with SR design and those that deal with tasks as required in SR. The review of both existing robots and techniques in the literature show a diversity of approaches to discuss SR issues. Nonetheless, it is easily noticeable from these works that there is a clamant absence of solid real-world applications of SR. An analysis of the interests and bottlenecks of this field indicates that the number of research works is smaller than those in other related areas. This suggests that, even though with many research studies, the field of SR is not yet mature enough, mainly due the absence of a universal methodology and generic robots that can be used in any, or at least in many, applications. Thus, we emphasize, discuss and analyze the urgent need for standardization of many aspects in SR, including hardware and software, as to allow a possible flourishing of SR applicability to real-world applications. This standardization could accelerate a great deal the field of SR, thus facilitating the development of SR solutions for applications that impact our daily life.},

Real-time path planning for heterogeneous multi-robot system under unknown 3D environment is a new challenging research and a hot spot in this field. In this paper, an improved real-time path planning method is proposed for a heterogeneous multi-robot system, which is composed of many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). In the proposed method, the 3D environment is modelled as a neuron topology map, based on the grid method combined with the bio-inspired neural network. Then a new 3D dynamic movement model for multi-robots is established based on an improved Dragonfly Algorithm (DA). Thus, the movements of the robots are optimized according to the activities of the neurons in the bio-inspired neural network to realize the real-time path planning. Furthermore, some simulations have been carried out. The results show that the proposed method can effectively guide the heterogeneous UAV/UGV system to the target, and has better performance than traditional methods in the real-time path planning tasks.},

Temporal constraints are expressed as time windows, within which a task must be executed. There are no restrictions on the time windows, which are allowed to overlap.  Robots model their temporal constraints using a simple temporal network, enabling them to maintain consistent schedules.  When bidding on a task, a robot takes into account its own current commitments and an optimization objective, which is to minimize the time of completion of the last task alone or in combination with minimizing the distance traveled. The algorithm works both when all the tasks are known upfront and when tasks arrive dynamically. We show the performance of the algorithm in simulation with different numbers of tasks and robots, and compare it with a baseline greedy algorithm and a state-of-the-art auction algorithm. Our algorithm is computationally frugal and consistently allocates more tasks than the competing algorithms.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of multi-robot task allocation using auctions, and study how lossy communication between the auctioneer and bidders affects solution quality. We demonstrate both analytically and experimentally that even though many auction algorithms have similar performance when communication is perfect, different auctions degrade in different ways as communication quality decreases from perfect to nonexistent. Thus, if a multi-robot system is expected to encounter lossy communication, then the auction algorithm that it uses for task allocation must be chosen carefully. We compare six auction algorithms including: standard implementations of the Sequential Auction, Parallel Auction, Combinatorial Auction; a generalization of the Prim Allocation Auction called G-Prim; and two multi-round variants of a Repeated Parallel Auction. Variants of these auctions are also considered in which award information from previous rounds is rebroadcast by the auctioneer during later rounds. We consider a variety of valuation functions used by the bidders, including: the total and maximum distance traveled (for distance based cost functions), the expected profit or cost to a robot (assuming robots' task values are drawn from a random distribution). Different auctioneer objectives are also evaluated, and include: maximizing profit (max sum), minimizing cost (min sum), and minimizing the maximum distance traveled by any particular robot (min max). In addition to the cost value functions that are used, we are also interested in fleet performance statistics such as the expected robot utilization rate, and the expected number of items won by each robot. Experiments are performed both in simulation and on real AscTec Pelican quad-rotor aircraft. In simulation, each algorithm is considered across communication qualities ranging from perfect to nonexistent. For the case of the distance-based cost functions, the performance of the auctions is compared using two different communication models: (1) a Bernoulli model and (2) the Gilbert--Elliot model. The particular auction that performs the best changes based on the the reliability of the communication between the bidders and the auctioneer. We find that G-Prim and its repeated variant perform relatively well when communication is poor, and that re-sending winner data in later rounds is an easy way improve the performance of multi-round auctions, in general.},

This leads to notions of world-embedded computation and world-embedded displays that provide different ways to think about robot colonies and the types of distributed computations that such colonies might perform.},

We propose a new take on the issue: Rather than classically developing new algorithms, we apply a macro-level paradigm, called aggregate computing, specifically designed to directly program the global behaviour of a whole ensemble of devices at once. To understand the potential of the application of aggregate computing to OMOkC, we extend the Alchemist simulator (supporting aggregate computing natively) with a novel toolchain component supporting the simulation of mobile robots. This way, we build a software engineering toolchain comprising language and simulation tooling for addressing OMOkC. Finally, we exercise our approach and related toolchain by introducing new algorithms for OMOkC; we show that they can be expressed concisely, reuse existing software components and perform better than the current state-of-the-art in terms of coverage over time and number of objects covered overall.},

We formulate a robust probabilistic adaptive defence mechanism which does not aim at identifying malicious agents, but to provide the swarm with the means to minimise the consequences of the attack. The mechanism relies on a dynamic modification of the probability of agents to change their current information in view of new contradictory or corroborating incoming data. We investigate several experimental conditions in simulation. The results show that the presence of adversaries in the swarm hinders reaching consensus to the majority opinion when using a baseline method, but that there are several conditions in which our adaptive defence mechanism is highly efficient.},

Networks with a single leader and several followers as well as leaderless networks are considered. Agents are modelled with first-order dynamics, and the inputs to each CO agent that enable consensus are designed using the principles of sliding mode control (SMC). An SMC-based consensus protocol (CP), derived using the Laplacian matrix of the graph describing the network that permits consensus amongst CO agents, is first illustrated; that MA agents can prevent consensus with the use of this CP is also discussed. The SMC-based RCP proposed in this paper requires that the CO agents know the bounds, defined by a statistical distribution, of other CO agents, and that the subgraph of the CO agents be connected; knowledge of MA agents is not needed. With these assumptions, in the case of networks with a single MA agent, CO agents can reach a consensus by disregarding information transmitted by this agent if its state violates some statistical properties. On the other hand, multiple MA agents can be disregarded without the need for these assumptions, owing to the relations that hold with the occurrence of sliding mode. The RCP consists of a message-passing algorithm whose basis can be found in the distributed computing literature. The proposed RCP can also be applied for a leader-follower network.},

  abstract = {Underwater exploration is important for mapping out the oceans, environmental monitoring, and search and rescue, yet water represents one of the most challenging of operational environments. The CoCoRo project proposes to address these challenges using cognitive swarm intelligent systems. We present here CoCoRoSim, an underwater swarm robotics simulation used in designing underwater swarm robotic systems. Collective coordination of robots represents principle challenge here, and use simulation in evaluating shoaling algorithm performance given the communication, localization and orientation challenges of underwater environments. We find communication to be essential for well-coordinated shoals, and provided communication is possible, inexact localization does not significantly impact performance. As a proof of concept simulation is employed in evaluating shoaling performance in turbulent waters.},

  abstract = {A Very Large Scale Robotic (VLSR) system may consist of from hundreds to perhaps tens of thousands or more autonomous robots. The costs of robots are going down, and the robots are getting more compact, more capable, and more flexible. Hence, in the near future, we expect to see many industrial and military applications of VLSR systems in tasks such as assembling, transporting, hazardous inspection, patrolling, guarding and attacking. In this paper, we propose a new approach for distributed autonomous control of VLSR systems. We define simple artificial force laws between pairs of robots or robot groups. The force laws are inverse-power force laws, incorporating both attraction and repulsion. The force laws can be distinct and to some degree they reflect the `social relations' among robots. Therefore we call our method social potential fields. An individual robot's motion is controlled by the resultant artificial force imposed by other robots and other components of the system. The approach is distributed in that the force calculations and motion control can be done in an asynchronous and distributed manner. We also extend the social potential fields model to use spring laws as force laws. This paper presents the first and a preliminary study on applying potential fields to distributed autonomous multi-robot control. We describe the genetic framework of our social potential fields method. We show with computer simulations that the method can yield interesting and useful behaviors among robots, and we give examples of possible industrial and military applications. We also identify theoretical problems for future studies.},

But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

  abstract = {This thesis concerns the use of artificial potential functions to solve the robot navigation problem in the context of perfect information. A class of potential functions--the navigation functions--is defined and shown to represent an exact solution to the problem. Essentially, these functions must have a unique minimum at the destination, be uniformly maximal on the obstacles' boundary, and be sufficiently smooth. Once a navigation function is constructed for a given obstacle course and desired destination, there is a natural and automatic way to derive from it a bounded-torque feedback control law for the robot. The resulting closed-loop robot system is guaranteed to approach the desired destination without hitting the obstacles. This methodology constitutes the only provably correct and, in principle, completely general alternative to the currently used method of first planning a collision-free path and then "forcing" the robot to follow it. Several theoretical insights concerning the expressive capability of potential functions are derived. First, in general, the best that can be hoped for is convergence from almost any initial position (strict global convergence is impossible using potential functions). Second, in principle, navigation functions always exist. It is then shown that navigation functions are invariant under coordinate transformation (diffeomorphism). This, in turn, affords actual construction of navigation functions as exemplified in the remainder of the thesis. Navigation functions are constructed on n-dimensional Euclidean sphere worlds, representing ideal obstacle course for a point-mass robot. The Euclidean sphere worlds serve as a "model" for their topological equivalence class. Navigation functions on the geometrically "complicated" spaces in this topological class are then constructed by "pulling back" a suitable prior construction on the corresponding model space via coordinate transformation. Coordinate transformations are constructed for progressively more complicated classes of n-dimensional spaces: the star worlds, star worlds with semianalytic obstacles, and the forests of stars. The last class turns out to be dense in the topologically deformed sphere worlds. The rich variety of shapes obtained by forests of stars is exemplified in the "floor plan", or "maze", picture furnished in Chapter 5. The thesis concludes with a description of research in progress, concerning the construction of navigation functions for a simple rigid body. Even the latter case is only a small portion of the most general problem of navigating a general robot amidst arbitrarily shaped obstacles. Thus, the thesis is merely a precursor to a much larger program of research committed to construction of navigation functions for progressively more realistic robotic situations.},

We focus on robot agents and emphasize the challenges of MAS sub-fields including task decomposition, coalition formation, task allocation, perception, and multi-agent planning and control. While some components have seen more advancements than others, more research is required before effective autonomous MAS can be deployed in real smart city settings that are less restrictive than the assumed validation environments of MAS.

In this kind of application domain, sending data through the environment presents issues that surpass the ones found in other overwater, distributed, cyber-physical systems (i.e., low bandwidth, unreliable transport medium, data representation and hardware high heterogeneity). This manuscript presents a Publish/Subscribe-based semantic middleware solution for unreliable scenarios and vehicle interoperability across cooperative and heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. The middleware relies on different iterations of the Data Distribution Service (DDS) software standard and their combined work between autonomous maritime vehicles and a control entity. It also uses several components with different functionalities deemed as mandatory for a semantic middleware architecture oriented to maritime operations (device and service registration, context awareness, access to the application layer) where other technologies are also interweaved with middleware (wireless communications, acoustic networks). Implementation details and test results, both in a laboratory and a deployment scenario, have been provided as a way to assess the quality of the system and its satisfactory performance.},

  abstract = {Multi-robot exploration means constructing a finite map using a group of robots in an obstacle chaotic space. Uncertainties are reduced by distributing search tasks to robots and computing the best action in real time. Many previous methods are based on deterministic or meta-heuristic algorithms, but limited work has combined both techniques to consolidate both classes' benefits and alleviate their drawbacks. This paper proposes a new hybrid method based on deterministic coordinated multi-robot exploration (CME) and the meta-heuristic salp swarm algorithm (SSA) to perform the search of a space. The precedence of adjacent cells around a robot is determined by deterministic CME using cost and utility. Then, the optimization process of the search space, improving the overall solution, is achieved utilizing the SSA. Three performance measures are considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed method: run time, percentage of the explored area, and the number of times when a method failed to continue a complete run. Experimental results compared four different methods, CME-GWO, CME-GWOSSA, CME-SCA, and CME, over seven maps with extra complexity varying from simple to complex. The results demonstrate how the proposed CME-SSA can outperform the four other methods. Moreover, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CME-SSA effectively distributes the robots over the search space to run successfully and obtain the highest exploration rate in less time.},

Each of the robots collects sensor data regarding its own motion and shares this information with the rest of the team during the update cycles. A single estimator, in the form of a Kalman filter, processes the available positioning information from all the members of the team and produces a pose estimate for every one of them. The equations for this centralized estimator can be written in a decentralized form, therefore allowing this single Kalman filter to be decomposed into a number of smaller communicating filters. Each of these filters processes the sensor data collected by its host robot. Exchange of information between the individual filters is necessary only when two robots detect each other and measure their relative pose. The resulting decentralized estimation schema, which we call collective localization, constitutes a unique means for fusing measurements collected from a variety of sensors with minimal communication and processing requirements. The distributed localization algorithm is applied to a group of three robots and the improvement in localization accuracy is presented. Finally, a comparison to the equivalent decentralized information filter is provided.},

To address this issue, this paper presents Kilobot, a low-cost robot designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers. To enable the possibility of large Kilobot collectives where the number of robots is an order of magnitude larger than the largest that exist today, each robot is made with only \$14 worth of parts and takes 5 minutes to assemble. Furthermore, the robot design allows a single user to easily operate a large Kilobot collective, such as programming, powering on, and charging all robots, which would be difficult or impossible to do with many existing robotic systems.},

The first one is the difficulty of designing all the modules and behaviors of the aerial multi-robot system. The second one is the difficulty of having an autonomous prototype of the system for the developers that allows to test the performance of each module even in an early stage of the project. These two problems motivate this paper. A multipurpose system architecture for autonomous multi-UAV platforms is presented. This versatile system architecture can be used by the system designers as a template when developing their own systems. The proposed system architecture is general enough to be used in a wide range of applications, as demonstrated in the paper. This system architecture aims to be a reference for all designers. Additionally, to allow for the fast prototyping of autonomous multi-aerial systems, an Open Source framework based on the previously defined system architecture is introduced. It allows developers to have a flight proven multi-aerial system ready to use, so that they can test their algorithms even in an early stage of the project. The implementation of this framework, introduced in the paper with the name of ``CVG Quadrotor Swarm'', which has also the advantages of being modular and compatible with different aerial platforms, can be found at https://github.com/Vision4UAV/cvg\_quadrotor\_swarmwith a consistent catalog of available modules. The good performance of this framework is demonstrated in the paper by choosing a basic instance of it and carrying out simulation and experimental tests whose results are summarized and discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {In swarm robotics multiple robots collectively solve problems by forming advantageous structures and behaviors similar to the ones observed in natural systems, such as swarms of bees, birds, or fish. However, the step to industrial applications has not yet been made successfully. Literature is light on real-world swarm applications that apply actual swarm algorithms. Typically, only parts of swarm algorithms are used which we refer to as basic swarm behaviors. In this paper we collect and categorize these behaviors into spatial organization, navigation, decision making, and miscellaneous. This taxonomy is then applied to categorize a number of existing swarm robotic applications from research and industrial domains. Along with the classification, we give a comprehensive overview of research platforms that can be used for testing and evaluating swarm behavior, systems that are already on the market, and projects that target a specific market. Results from this survey show that swarm robotic applications are still rare today. Many industrial projects still rely on centralized control, and even though a solution with multiple robots is employed, the principal idea of swarm robotics of distributed decision making is neglected. We identified mainly following reasons: First of all, swarm behavior emerging from local interactions is hard to predict and a proof of its eligibility for applications in an industrial context is difficult to provide. Second, current communication architectures often do not match requirements for swarm communication, which often leads to a system with a centralized communication infrastructure. Finally, testing swarms for real industrial applications is an issue, since deployment in a productive environment is typically too risky and simulations of a target system may not be sufficiently accurate. In contrast, the research platforms present a means for transforming swarm robotics solutions from theory to prototype industrial systems.},

Important communication factors, such as latency and packet delivery ratio, are strong functions of the number of agents in the network. Findings from studies of mobile and high node-count radio-frequency (RF) mesh networks have only been transferred to the domain of multi-robot systems to a limited extent, and typical multi-agent robotic simulators often depend on simple propagation models that do not reflect the behavior of realistic RF networks. In this paper, we present a new open source swarm robotics simulator, BotNet, with an embedded standards-compliant time-synchronized channel hopping (6TiSCH) RF mesh network simulator. Using this simulator we show how more accurate communications models can limit even simple multi-robot control tasks such as flocking and formation control, with agent counts ranging from 10 up to 2500 agents. The experimental results are used to motivate changes to the inter-robot communication propagation models and other networking components currently used in practice in order to bridge the sim-to-real gap.},

During an emergency situation within a building it is crucial to explore the area as fast as possible in order to search and find the wounded people and other hazards. On account of the prevailing breakdown of communication in indoor environments in some situations, it is suggested that the robots can communicate indirectly with the use of markings in the environment. The Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) method, proposed for this problem, suffers in environments that have partially occupied cells and narrow door openings between rooms. In this paper, we consider an extension of the Simultaneous Multiple STC (S-MSTC) algorithm, which we proposed in our previous work on multiple autonomous robots used in exploration and coverage in an unknown terrain. The proposed extended S-MSTC (ES-MSTC) uses ant-type robots to cover the terrain leaving marks on the terrain, which can be sensed by the robots and allow them to cover the terrain, similar to the nature of ants. This algorithm can handle partially occupied cells and narrow door openings in the terrain and performs a complete coverage of the surface regardless of the shape of the environment by constructing multiple spanning trees simultaneously. We present a simulation study and compare the performance of the ES-MSTC algorithm with other existing algorithms.},

In this paper, we extend the problem of collective perception from simple binary decision-making of choosing the color in majority to estimating the most likely fill ratio from a series of discrete fill ratio hypotheses. We have applied direct comparison (DC) and direct modulation of voter-based decisions (DMVD) to this scenario to observe their performances in a discrete collective estimation problem. We have also compared their performances against an Individual Exploration baseline. Additionally, we propose a novel collective decision-making strategy called distributed Bayesian belief sharing (DBBS) and apply it to the above discrete collective estimation problem. In the experiments, we explore the performances of considered collective decision-making algorithms in various parameter settings to determine the trade-off among accuracy, speed, message transfer and reliability in the decision-making process. Our results show that both DC and DMVD outperform the Individual Exploration baseline, but both algorithms exhibit different trade-offs with respect to accuracy and decision speed. On the other hand, DBBS exceeds the performances of all other considered algorithms in all four metrics, at the cost of higher communication complexity.},

In this paper we propose a novel algorithm basing on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) model. In this algorithm, a virtual pheromone based communication mechanism is adopted to decrease the communication cost and optimize the cooperation between nodes. For the nodes, there are two phases, exploration and exploitation, with different indicators in the PSO model. By switching between these two phases, the swarm completes the task of map coverage. A series of experiments on simulator is carried out and proves the convergence and excellent scalability of our algorithm. By optimizing some parameter in the PSO model with the simulator, the efficiency of map-coverage is further improved.},

Their guiding principles are based on their biological inspiration and take the form of an emphasis on decentralized local control and communication. Earlier studies went a step further in emphasizing the use of simple reactive robots that only communicate indirectly through the environment. More recently SR studies have moved beyond these constraints to explore the use of non-reactive robots that communicate directly, and that can learn and represent their environment. There is no clear agreement in the literature about how far such extensions of the original principles could go. Should there be any limitations on the individual abilities of the robots used in SR studies? Should knowledge of the capabilities of social insects lead to constraints on the capabilities of individual robots in SR studies? There is a lack of explicit discussion of such questions, and researchers have adopted a variety of constraints for a variety of reasons. A simple taxonomy of swarm robotics is presented here with the aim of addressing and clarifying these questions. The taxonomy distinguishes subareas of SR based on the emphases and justifications for minimalism and individual simplicity.},

Chain networks connecting a base station and rescue robots are essential to reconnoiter distant spaces in disaster areas. The chains must be formed to assure communications among them and must be transformed if the target of exploration changes. These formations must be executed by autonomous movements of robots from reliable viewpoints in rescue operations. As the basis of their movements, we adopt autonomous classification of robots into search robots and relay robots. They act according to the behavior algorithms of each class of robot to form chain network threading the path to the distant spaces. The rule of the classification and the behavior algorithm refer forwarding table of each robot constructed for ad hoc networking. The results of simulations show that chain networks are formed and transformed by rescue robots appropriately for their reconnaissance to distant spaces even though three spaces exist beyond different corridors stemming from the safety zone where base station is established.},

We build on our previous work on adaptive self-assembly within the three-layer model for autonomous systems to provide a decentralised technique for self-assembly. To achieve this in a fault-tolerant and scalable manner, we use a gossip protocol as a basis. While no central or leader node is aware of the full space of solutions, gossip ensures that agreement on a particular solution - in this case a component configuration - is reached in a logarithmic number of steps with respect to the size of the network.},

Inspired by natural systems in which large numbers of simple agents (e.g., schooling fish, flocking birds, swarming insects) perform complicated collective behaviours for efficiency and safety, the first element uses three simple rules to maintain a swarm formation. The second element provides a means to select promising regions to explore (and cover) by minimising a cost function involving robots' relative distance to frontier cells and the frontier's size. We tested the performance of our approach on heterogeneous and homogeneous groups of mobile robots in different environments.

To minimize the time to find the victim, some fundamental parameters need to be accounted for in the design of the search algorithms: 1) quality of sensory data collected by the UAVs, 2) UAVs energy limitations, 3) environmental hazards (e.g. winds, trees), 4) level of information exchange/coordination between UAVs. In this paper, we discuss how these parameters can affect the search task and present some of the research avenues we have been exploring.

  abstract = {Autonomous exploration is one of the key components for flying robots in 3D active perception. Fast and accurate exploration algorithms are essential for aerial vehicles due to their limited flight endurance. In this paper, we address the problem of exploring the environment and acquiring information using aerial vehicles within limited flight endurance. We propose an information potential field based method for autonomous exploration in 3D environments. In contrast to the existing approaches that only consider either the traveled distances or the information collected during exploration, our method takes into account both the traveled cost and information-gain. The next best view point is chosen based on a multi-objective function which considers information of several candidate regions and the traveled path cost. The selected goal attracts the robot while the known obstacles form the repulsive force to repel the robot. These combined force drives the robot to explore the environment. Different from planners that use all acquired global information, our planner only considers the goal selected and the nearby obstacles, which is more efficient in high-dimensional environments. Furthermore, we present a method to help the robot escape when it falls into a trapped area. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed method.},

  abstract = {Self-adaptation is typically realized using a control loop. One prominent approach for organizing a control loop in self-adaptive systems is by means of four components that are responsible for the primary functions of self-adaptation: Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute, together forming a MAPE loop. When systems are large, complex, and heterogeneous, a single MAPE loop may not be sufficient for managing all adaptation in a system, so multiple MAPE loops may be introduced. In self-adaptive systems with multiple MAPE loops, decisions about how to decentralize each of the MAPE functions must be made. These decisions involve how and whether the corresponding functions from multiple loops are to be coordinated (e.g., planning components coordinating to prepare a plan for an adaptation). To foster comprehension of self-adaptive systems with multiple MAPE loops and support reuse of known solutions, it is crucial that we document common design approaches for engineers. As such systematic knowledge is currently lacking, it is timely to reflect on these systems to: (a) consolidate the knowledge in this area, and (b) to develop a systematic approach for describing different types of control in self-adaptive systems. We contribute with a simple notation for describing interacting MAPE loops, which we believe helps in achieving (b), and we use this notation to describe a number of existing patterns of interacting MAPE loops, to begin to fulfill (a). From our study, we outline numerous remaining research challenges in this area.},

Here we present a method for swarm self-monitoring that enables the aggregate display of information about swarm location by making use of physical transport of information and local communication. This method uses movement already exhibited by many swarms to collect self-reflective information in a fully distributed manner. We find that added swarm mobility can compensate for limited communication and that our self-monitoring swarm system scales well, with performance increasing with the size of the swarm in some cases. When developing systems such as this for real-world applications, individual agent memory will need to be taken into consideration, finding an effective means to spread swarm knowledge among robots while keeping information accessible to users.},

Formation control is one of the most challenging goals for the coordination control of swarm robots. In this paper, a behavior-based control design approach is proposed for two kinds of important formation control problems: efficient initial formation and formation control while avoiding obstacles. In this approach, a classification-based searching method for generating large-scale robot formation is presented to reduce the computational complexity and speed up the initial formation process for any desired formation. The behavior-based method is applied for the formation control of swarm robot systems while navigating in an unknown environment with obstacles. Several groups of experimental results demonstrate the success of the proposed approach. These methods have potential applications for various swarm robot systems in both the simulation and the practical environments.},

  abstract = {Flocks of starlings exhibit a remarkable ability to maintain cohesion as a group in highly uncertain environments and with limited, noisy information. Recent work demonstrated that individual starlings within large flocks respond to a fixed number of nearest neighbors, but until now it was not understood why this number is seven. We analyze robustness to uncertainty of consensus in empirical data from multiple starling flocks and show that the flock interaction networks with six or seven neighbors optimize the trade-off between group cohesion and individual effort. We can distinguish these numbers of neighbors from fewer or greater numbers using our systems-theoretic approach to measuring robustness of interaction networks as a function of the network structure, i.e., who is sensing whom. The metric quantifies the disagreement within the network due to disturbances and noise during consensus behavior and can be evaluated over a parameterized family of hypothesized sensing strategies (here the parameter is number of neighbors). We use this approach to further show that for the range of flocks studied the optimal number of neighbors does not depend on the number of birds within a flock; rather, it depends on the shape, notably the thickness, of the flock. The results suggest that robustness to uncertainty may have been a factor in the evolution of flocking for starlings. More generally, our results elucidate the role of the interaction network on uncertainty management in collective behavior, and motivate the application of our approach to other biological networks.},

Based on the relative motion between each pair of neighboring agents, we introduce a neighbor screening protocol, by which each agent only focuses on its neighbors, which have the relative motion that violates the formation of flocks. Then, a truly distributed MPC flocking algorithm (Algorithm 1) is designed with consideration of neighbor screening mechanism. Specifically, at each sampling instant, each agent monitors the information in the networked system, finds its neighbors to form its subsystem, determines the screened neighbor set, and optimizes its plan by collecting the position states within the screened subsystem. And geometric properties of the optimal path are used to guarantee the formation of the flock without inter-agent collision. Finally, the performance and advantage of the proposed distributed MPC flocking strategy are vividly verified by the simulation results. Copyright {\copyright} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Current studies usually focus on the complete failure of the individual in the swarm where the individual and/or its connections are removed and/or rewired.

Three motion models and their corresponding resilience processes are proposed respectively given three partial failure modes. Furthermore, an improved resilience evaluation metric considering the absolute time scale and minimum mission performance requirement is proposed. The collective behavior and resilience process under different partial failures and strategies are studied through simulations. The results reveal the swarm resilience decreases as the swarm size increases, and the swarm resilience is sensitive to degree and location failure strategy.},

And it is proven that there is a positive lower limit of the interval between any two trigger events, which indicates that the Zeno behavior will not occur. As a result, communication bandwidth resources are effectively saved on the premise of stable flocking. Lastly, numerical simulations are presented to verify the availability of the theoretical results.},
